The goal of this project, made with JavaScript, is to simply guess the secret number which is between 1 and 20. 
We start with a score of 20, and after each failed guess, the score decreases by 1. 
When we guess the correct number for the first time, we set a high score.
If we want to play again, we can simply click the 'Again!' button, which resets everything except for the high score. 
If you guess the number faster than the first time, the high score will be updated
